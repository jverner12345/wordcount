# Word Count

## Applications

+ WordCountEntryPoint (Console Application)
+ WordCount.Api (Web Api)

### WordCounEntryPoint
This application is to allow a user to run the application via a console application. This simply allows a user to update the Progam.cs file to directly return the response from the Logic application(***WordCountLogic***)

### WordCount.Api
This web-api builds upon the EntryPoint application providing a better ui for the user to carry out word count operations. Here we can now both provide a .txt file to be processed as well as simply providing a string via the GET endpoint.
